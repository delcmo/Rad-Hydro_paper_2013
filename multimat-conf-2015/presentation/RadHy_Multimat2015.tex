%\setlength{\itemsep}{10pt}
\item Relaxation term in the energy and radiation equations: ${\color{blue}\sigma_a c \left( a T^4 - \epsilon \right)}$.% behaves like a diffusion term when $\sigma_a \to \infty$ \cite{ShiJin}.

\item The above system of equations is NOT hyperbolic.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Quick overview of the entropy-based artificial viscosity formalism}

General scalar conservation law: $\boxed{\partial_t u + \div \vec{f}(u) = 0}$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Add viscous fluxes $\boxed{\partial_t u + \div \vec{f}(u) = \div \mu \grad u}$
\item 
Let the amount of \hili{artificial viscosity} $\mu$ be \hili{$\propto$} the \hili{local entropy production}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Determine an entropy pair ($s(u),\, \vec{\Psi}(u)$) for the PDE under consideration
\item 
Compute the entropy residual $\boxed{R_e:=\partial_t s(u_h) + \div \Psi(u_h)}$, in each cell $K$, at each quadrature point $x_q$
\item 
Compute the speed and kinematic \hili{entropy viscosity} associated with this residual
\be
v^K_e(x_q)  := h_K \frac{|R_e(x_q)|_K}{|s-\overline{s}|_\infty}
\quad \text{and} \quad 
\mu^K_e(x_q):= h_K v^K_e(x_q) 
\ee
%The denominator is used to normalize the residual
%. It is the deviation of $E(u)$ from the domain average $\overline{E}$.
\end{itemize}
\item 
Limit the viscosity: upper bound = \hili{Local Lax-Friedrichs} (LLF) viscosity
\be
\mu^K(x_q) := \min \Big( \tcr{\frac{h_K}{2} \max_{x\in K}|\vec{f}'(u(x))|}, \, \tcb{\mu^K_e(x_q)} \Big)
\ee
\item 
Plug in the standard Galerkin weak form as a \tcm{viscous regularization} %(\tcm{it is really a straightforward technique})
\be
\int_V \big( \partial_t u_h + \div \vec{f}(u_h) \big) b \, dx + \tcm{\sum_K \int_K \mu^K \grad u_h \cdot \grad b \, dx} = 0 \quad \forall b

%
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{block}{Goal: To obtain an entropy relationship: $\rho ( \partial_t s + \vec{u} \cdot \grad s ) = \ldots  \tcr{\ge 0}$}
Entropy is a function of density $\rho$ and internal energy $e$. Using chain rule, we have
\[
\partial_\alpha s = s_\rho \tcr{\partial_\alpha \rho} + s_e \tcr{\partial_\alpha e} \quad \text{ with } \alpha={t,x}
\]
Now, re-write Euler equations in non-conservative form as a function of $\rho$, $u$, and $e$.
\end{block}
%
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{block}{Entropy equation}
%Use chain rule and the mass and internal energy equations to get:
The following choice of viscous fluxes, $\vec{f} = \kappa \grad \rho$, $\mathbb{g} = \mu \rho \grad^s \vec{u} + \vec{u}\otimes \vec{f}$,and $\vec{h} = \kappa \grad(\rho e) -\tfrac{1}{2}u^2 \vec{f} + \mathbb{g}\cdot \vec{u}$, yields:
\begin{equation}
\rho \left( \partial_t s + \mbold{u} \cdot \grad s \right) = 
\div \left( \rho \kappa \grad s \right) -  \kappa \rho \mathbf{Q} +  s_e \mu \grad^s \mbold{u} : \grad \mbold{u}\nonumber
\end{equation}
\end{block}
%
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{block}{Quadratic form}
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Q} = X^t \mathbb{\Sigma} X 
\quad \text{ with } 
X = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\grad \rho \\
\grad e 
\end{bmatrix}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Add viscous regularization (fluxes) to the equations

\item With \tcr{$s(\rho,e,\epsilon)$}, use chain rule to obtain the entropy relationship

\begin{block}{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Extended the entropy-viscosity method to the \hili{full} Grey Radiation-Hydrodynamic equations.
\item Verified the entropy minimum principle for the regularized equations GRHD.
\item Viscous regularization scales appropriately in the equilibrium-diffusion limit.
\item Numerical results are in excellent agreement with semi-analytical solutions.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Outlook}
\begin{itemize}
\item Multi-D.
\item Replace radiation diffusion with $S_n$ radiation transport.
\item Switch solution technique to IMEX (implicit for radiation, explicit for hydro).
\item Other spatial discretization (DGFEM).
\item FCT \\

\underline{Example: linear advection} $\partial_t u + \beta \partial_x u =0$
\be
\beta \frac{u_i - u_{i-1}}{h} = \textcolor{blue}{\beta\frac{ u_{i+1}- u_{i-1}}{2h}} - \textcolor{red}{\frac{\beta h}{2}}

So, the dissipative term is $\frac{\beta h}{2}\partial_{xx} u$
and the first-order viscosity is $\frac{\beta h}{2}$
