\subsection{A Brief Review of the Entropy Viscosity Method for Conservation Laws}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Quick overview of the entropy-based artificial viscosity formalism}

General scalar conservation law: $\boxed{\partial_t u + \div \vec{f}(u) = 0}$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Add viscous fluxes $\boxed{\partial_t u + \div \vec{f}(u) = \div \mu \grad u}$
\item 
Let the amount of \hili{artificial viscosity} $\mu$ be \hili{$\propto$} the \hili{local entropy production}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Determine an entropy pair ($s(u),\, \vec{\Psi}(u)$) for the PDE under consideration
\item 
Compute the entropy residual $\boxed{R_e:=\partial_t s(u_h) + \div \Psi(u_h)}$, in each cell $K$, at each quadrature point $x_q$
\item 
Compute the speed and kinematic \hili{entropy viscosity} associated with this residual
\be
v^K_e(x_q)  := h_K \frac{|R_e(x_q)|_K}{|s-\overline{s}|_\infty}
\quad \text{and} \quad 
\mu^K_e(x_q):= h_K v^K_e(x_q) 
\ee
%The denominator is used to normalize the residual
%. It is the deviation of $E(u)$ from the domain average $\overline{E}$.
\end{itemize}
\item 
Limit the viscosity upper bound to the \hili{Local Lax-Friedrichs} (LLF) viscosity
\be
\mu^K(x_q) := \min \Big( \tcr{\frac{h_K}{2} \max_{x\in K}|\vec{f}'(u(x))|}, \, \tcb{\mu^K_e(x_q)} \Big)
\ee
\item 
Plug in the standard Galerkin weak form as a \tcm{viscous regularization} %(\tcm{it is really a straightforward technique})
\be
\int_V \big( \partial_t u_h + \div \vec{f}(u_h) \big) b \, dx + \tcm{\sum_K \int_K \mu^K \grad u_h \grad b \, dx} = 0 \quad \forall b
\ee

\begin{block}{Upper bound for $\mu$}
First-order upwind scheme is monotone but over dissipative. We should not exceed the amount of stabilization that such a scheme provides.\\
\medskip
upwinding = \textcolor{blue}{centered approximation (Galerkin)} $-$ \textcolor{magenta}{numerical diffusion}\\
\underline{Example: linear advection} $\partial_t u + \beta \partial_x u =0$
\be
\beta \frac{u_i - u_{i-1}}{h} = \textcolor{blue}{\beta\frac{ u_{i+1}- u_{i-1}}{2h}} - \textcolor{red}{\frac{\beta h}{2}}
\textcolor{magenta}{\frac{ u_{i+1}-2u_i +u_{i-1}}{h^2}}
\ee
So, the dissipative term is $\frac{\beta h}{2}\partial_{xx} u$
and the first-order viscosity is $\frac{\beta h}{2}$

\begin{frame}{Idea of the derivation}

\begin{block}{Entropy relationship: $\partial_t s + \vec{u} \cdot \grad s = \ldots $}
Entropy is a function of internal energy $e$ and density $\rho$. Using chain rule, we have
\[
\partial_\alpha s = s_\rho \partial_\alpha \rho + s_e \partial_\alpha e \quad \text{ with } \alpha={t,x}
\]
Re-write Euler equations in non-conservative form as a function of $\rho$, $u$, and $e$
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Entropy equation}
Use chain rule and the mass and internal energy equations to get:
\begin{align}
\rho \left( \partial_t s + \mbold{u} \cdot \grad s \right) = \div \left( \rho \kappa \grad s \right) -  \kappa \rho \mathbf{Q} +  s_e \mu \grad^s \mbold{u} : \grad \mbold{u} \nonumber
\end{align}
\end{block}
%
\begin{block}{Quadratic form}
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Q} = X^t \mathbb{\Sigma} X 
\quad \text{ with } 
X = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\grad \rho \\
\grad e 
\end{bmatrix}
\text{ and } 
\mathbb{\Sigma} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
       \partial_{\rho} (\rho^2 \partial_{\rho} s) & \partial_{\rho,e} s  \\[0.3em]
       \partial_{\rho,e} s & \partial_{e,e} s           \\[0.3em]

\end{equation}
The form $Q$ is negative definite if and only if $-s$ is convex with respect to $e$ and $\rho^{-1}$.

\section{Extension of the Entropy Viscosity Method to Low-Mach Flows}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{New Formulation of the Entropy Residual}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame} 
\frametitle{\textcolor{red}{Low-Mach issues} with current viscosity definitions}

Recall that 

\begin{equation}
\mu^K_e(\vec{r}_q,t) =  h_K^2 \frac{|\resi^K(\vec{r}_q,t) |}{\textcolor{magenta}{|| s - \bar{s} ||_\infty}} 
%\qquad
%\kappa^K_e(\vec{r}_q,t) = \Pr \, \mu^K_e(\vec{r}_q,t)
\end{equation}


\begin{block}{Issues with current formulation in the low-Mach limit}
\begin{itemize}
\item In the low-Mach Regime, the flow is known to be \textcolor{red}{isentropic}, resulting in very little entropy production
\item In practice, the entropy residual $\resi$ will be very small in that regime  (i.e., small numerator in the expression for the viscosity coefficients)
\item and so will be the denominator $|| s - \bar{s} ||_\infty$,
\item Thus, the formula for the viscosity coefficients are not determined \textcolor{red}{(ill-scaled) in the low-Mach limit}
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame} 
\frametitle{Alternate definition of the entropy residual}

We can show that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ent_res}
\resi(\vec{r},t) := \partial_t s + \vec{u} \cdot \grad s = \matder{s} = \frac{s_e}{P_e} \underbrace{\left( \matder{P} - c^2 \matder{\rho} \right)}_{\resinew(\vec{r},t)} 
\end{equation} 

Idea for the demonstration: 
$s$ is a function of $e$ and $\rho$, thus $\matder{s} = s_e\matder{e} + s_\rho \matder{\rho}$\\
Re-express the internal energy $e$ as a function of $P$ and $\rho$ through the EoS.

\begin{block}{Consequences}
\begin{itemize}
\item Residuals $\resi$ and $\resinew$ are proportional to one another %and will experience similar variations in space and time. 
\item We elect to employ $\resinew$ instead of $\resi$ %for the evaluation of the local entropy residual.
\item {\it An analytical expression of the entropy function $s$ is no longer needed} %: the residual $\resinew$ is evaluated using the local values of $P\,,\rho\,,u\,,c$ %pressure, density, velocity and speed of sound.
\item \textcolor{red}{Suitable normalizations for the residual} $\resinew$ can be devised (e.g., $P$, $\rho c^2$, $\rho c || \vec{u} ||$ or $\rho || \vec{u} ||^2$)%. Examples include the pressure itself or combinations of the density, the speed of sound and the norm of the velocity, i.e., $\rho c^2$, $\rho c || \vec{u} ||$ or $\rho || \vec{u} ||^2$. 
\end{itemize}
\end{block}


%\begin{block}{What is a proper normalization for $\resinew(\vec{r},t)$?}
%Requirements
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item To recover the incompressible results in the low-Mach limit %(i.e., pressure fluctuations $\propto M^2$; divergence-free flow; incompressible continuity equation)
%\item To remain valid and accurate for supersonic flows

\begin{block}{Pressure spatial fluctuations}
To recover the low-Mach results that the leading order and first-order pressure terms ($P_0$ and $P_1$) are spatially constant, we require \textcolor{red}{$\Re_\infty = \Pe_\infty = 1$}. \\
$\longrightarrow$ pressure fluctuations $\propto M^2$
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Divergence of the flow}
With this scaling, one can also show that
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \rho_0 + \vec{u}_0 \cdot \div \rho_0 = 0 \, .
\end{equation}
$\longrightarrow$ steady-state divergence-free flows.

%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:asympt_equ2_mom}
%\partial_t (\rho \vec{u})_0 + \div ( \rho \vec{u} \otimes \vec{u})_0 + \grad P_2 = \div (\rho \mu \grad^s \vec{u} +\kappa \vec{u} \otimes \grad \rho )_0
%\end{equation}
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:asympt_equ2_ener}

%\end{subequations}
%
%This is consistent with the \textcolor{magenta}{the results in the incompressible limit}


Therefore, by setting the $\Re_\infty=\Pe_\infty=1$, the \tcr{incompressible fluid results are retrieved in the low-Mach limit when employing the compressible Euler equations {\it with viscous regularization terms present}.}

%Using \eqt{eq:leading_order_eos}, the energy equation can be recast as a function of the leading-order pressure, $P_0$, as follows:

\frametitle{Back to $\norm_P^\mu$ and $\norm_P^\kappa$}

From the definition of the entropy viscosity coefficient $\left( \kappa^K_e(\vec{r}_q,t)    = h_K^2 \frac{ | \resinew^K(\vec{r}_q,t) | }{\norm_P^\kappa} \right)$, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:norm_relation}
\kappa_\infty 
= L_\infty^2  \frac{ \rho_\infty c_\infty^2 }{ L_\infty/u_\infty  \norm_{P,\infty}^{\kappa} }
\quad \to \quad \boxed{\norm_{P,\infty}^{\kappa} = \Pe_\infty \rho_\infty c_\infty^2} 
%= \frac{ \rho_\infty c_\infty^2 u_\infty L_\infty }{ \norm_{P,\infty}^{\kappa} } \, .
\end{equation}

Since $\Pe$ scales as unity,  we obtain:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:norm_relation_bis}
\boxed{\norm_{P,\infty}^{\kappa} =  \rho_\infty c_\infty^2 } \, .
\end{equation}
%
\eqt{eq:norm_relation_bis} provides a proper normalization factor to define the $\kappa$ viscosity coefficient.\\

\medskip 
Similarly :  $\norm_{P,\infty}^{\mu} = \rho_\infty c_\infty^2 $.

\begin{block}{Thus, the new definitions for the viscosities in the low-Mach limit are}

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \rho + \div \bs{m} - \tcr{\div \bs{f}} = 0
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \bs{m} + \div (\bs{u} \otimes \bs{m}) + \grad p - \tcr{\div \mathbb{g}}  = 0

The viscous fluxes $\bs{f}\,,\mathbb{g}\,,\bs{h}$ need to be determined. \ \ \textcolor{red}{How?} \\

\medskip

By proving that the equations {\it with regularization terms} satisfy a minimum principle on the specific entropy:
\begin{block}{Minimum entropy principle}
\be
\inf_{x\in \mathbb{R}^d} s(x,t) \ge \inf_{x\in \mathbb{R}^d} s_0(x) \qquad \forall t \ge 0
\ee
