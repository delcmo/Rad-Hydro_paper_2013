\noindent Manuscript \# FLD-16-0027 \\
Title: ``Regularization of the non-equilibrium Grey Radiation-Hydrodynamic equations with an artificial viscosity method', \\
{\it International Journal for Numerical Methods in Fluids}\\

\bigskip

{\color{blue}
Comments to the Author: \\ 
The manuscript describes an artificial viscosity method to solve a non-conservative hyperbolic model of coupled hydrodynamics and radiation. The manuscript is well written and of good technical level.
Important details are however missing in the present manuscript version.\\}
Thank you.
\bigskip

{\color{blue}
1. The flow model is presented in page 4. Its limitations are not mentioned. What are the assumptions? For which kind of application this model can be used. This is important for the reader. \\}

\bigskip

{\color{blue}
2. Page 5, Section 2.3. Because of their hyperbolic nature the GRH equations can develop shocks.
Could you explain/detail what shock structure is expected? One could expect constant radiation through the shock.
If the shock relations are known, they should be presented with System 5 and commented. Page 13 the reader is directed to Refs 24 and 28 meaning these relations are available.\\}
We are not presenting these relations since we are not using them in this work. These relations are indeed available in references 24 and 28. \tcb{I am not sure what he/she means by shock structure}
\bigskip

{\color{blue}
3. Several times the authors refer to Ref 6. Is the method of that reference in agreement with the shock relations of Refs 24-28?
\\}

\bigskip

{\color{blue}
4. Section 6. The results at steady state are compared with an exact solution. It should be presented in an Appendix with illustrations showing the configuration studied as well as boundary conditions. \\}

\bigskip

{\color{blue}
\noindent Minor concerns: \\
\indent 1. Page 4,5 lines from bottom: ?can be derived hyperbolic parts of the GRH? ... please correct.\\}
Thank you.

 Thank you.
