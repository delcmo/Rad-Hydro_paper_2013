Please find attached a revised version of our manuscript titled 
``Viscous regularization of the full set of nonequilibrium-diffusion grey radiation-hydrodynamic equations''
(we slightly updated the old title ``Viscous Regularization of the non-equilibrium Grey Radiation-Hydrodynamics'' 
for exactness) for consideration in the ``MultiMat-2015'' special issue of IJNMF. 

We have appreciated the comments of the reviewers. Reviewer \# 2 was satisfied with our first revision
and ``applauded'' the extra effort we did to incorporate the normed error analysis in the revision.

Please find attached our responses to Reviewer \#1. Reviewer \# 1 mostly required
some additional information and/or phrasing and  we believe that we have adequately addressed 
all of their remarks. We hope that our paper will be found suitable for publication.
