Please find attached a revised version of our manuscript titled ``Viscous Regularization of the non-equilibrium Grey Radiation-Hydrodynamics'' for consideration in the ``MultiMat-2015'' special issue of IJNMF. 

We appreciated the comments of the reviewers as they have allowed us to significantly improve the paper.


Please find attached one file with our responses to Reviewer \#1. Reviewer \# 2 did not request a response. We believe that we have adequately addressed all of his questions and hope that our paper will be found suitable for publication.
